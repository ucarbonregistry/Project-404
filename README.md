Avoidance of methane emissions through composting at Nisol, Jahaj, India

UNFCCC CDM AMS-III.F. Small-scale
methodology Avoidance of methane emissions
through composting, Version 12.0

The project activity Avoidance of methane emissions through composting at Nisol, Jahaj, India
is located at Survey N. 114/115 P, Dharmaj - Khambhat Road, Village: Jahaj, Taluka: Khambhat,
District: Anand, State Gujarat, Country: India.

Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity is the composting of the agro-industrial biomass waste (tobacco dust) from
activities at M/s. Nisol Manufacturing Company Private Limited (NMCPL). The project
proponent (NMCPL or PP), operates a nicotine sulphate agro-industrial manufacturing plant whose
waste product is tobacco dust.

The main use of nicotine sulphate is as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in smoking
cessation products such as nicotine chewing gums, nicotine patches, lozenges, and nasal sprays.
The project activity avoids the emissions of methane (a GHG) to the atmosphere from biomass
(tobacco dust) that would have otherwise been left to decay anaerobically in a solid waste disposal
site (SWDS), by composting. The produced compost is handled aerobically and submitted to soil
application without resulting in methane (CH4) emissions.

The waste materials are collected from within the project boundary and treated aerobically to
produce the organic fertilizer. The organic fertilizer thus produced is sold to farmers for
sustainable soil applications. The total quantity of waste treated is 2064 tonnes each month till
2016 and 3500 tonnes each month from 2017 onwards.

The baseline scenario is the situation where, in the absence of the project activity, the waste
materials would have continued to be dumped at an existing unscientific and ordinary landfill,
which is the most common practice of disposal of solid wastes in the country. This would have
resulted in anaerobic decomposition of the waste materials and generation of methane due to
anaerobic decay.

The project activity was commissioned on 30/05/2009. The yearly emission reductions achieved
by the project activity is estimated to be 28548 tCO2e/yr. During the current UCR monitoring
period, the plant underwent continued operation, except scheduled maintenance or breakdown.
